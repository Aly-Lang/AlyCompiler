# AlyCompiler TODO:

- [x] Lex source into tokens or something.

- [ ] Parse tokens or something into AST -- Just a tree containing data about the program.

- [ ] Compile AST into assembly, let's start with `86_64?` We could also transpile into another language that then gets compiled, like C or something.

## Potential Ideas

1. [ ] Make a runtime evaluator, so that way to get compile time code.
